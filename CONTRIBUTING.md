Well you came to the right place!

Welcome to the 101 on How to Contribute to this repo. This page will show you how to screenshot in NSMRS properly to stock photo standards, how to upload, and requesting a pull request to the repo branch.

# Screenshotting Criteria
When you upload and request a pull request for you screenshot, your pull request will be reviewed in order to reduce the number of inappropriate/spam screenshots. It is highly suggested that you take a screenshot with the following criteria:
- No mouse cursor (unless you strategically can't)
- Little to no UI contents (that includes the menu bar)
- Having your character in the picture is OK, but your character cannot cover the main point of the picture (your character must also be appropriate)
- Graphics level on your Roblox client must be manual set for 5/6 bars or greater (7/8+ is recommended)
- The picture must be in an appropriate position
- The picture canvas resolution should be the minimum of 1920x1080 (for 16:9) or 1920x1200 (for 16:10) or greater* (minus per 2nd rule)<br>
_*This might change to 1280x720._

If you have access to freecam, it is best if you use that.

# Uploading & Submitting a Pull Request*
1. Take the screenshot you shot and rename the file into a descriptive name (like "ReactorChamber" - If there are several in the same general area, name like "ReactorChamber1", "ReactorChamber2", and vice versa)

_From this point, there are two options where you can push commit to open a pull request, but for now, I'll give you the simple one._

_**ONLY FOLLOW STEPS 2, 3, & 4 IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FORK. YOU WILL ONLY NEED ONE FORK.**_
